I originally wrote my vows and uploaded them to a website for you just like this. A few months later and that website was taken down and I had no backups--so my original vows were lost. So today, in December of 2018--after 9 awesome months, I want to renew my vows to you with a fresh perspective. I'm sorry I lost the original vows--but I promise these will be better. <br/><br/> My beautiful Mireille, it is very hard to express in words how much I love and care for you. Love to me, is sharing the French Onion dip--even when you don't want to. Love is watching movies with me--even when its a movie you have no interest in watching. Love is fixing my lunch for me every morning--even when I take it for granted and forget to say thank you. Love is letting me get a cat--even when you told me it was a mistake but you let me learn that lesson on my own, the hard way. Love is staying up late and waiting for me, and getting up early to work out with me. Our love--to me, is just the way we can say stupid and silly words that we make up to each other and laugh about it. <br/><br/> We were together when you bought your first nice car. We were together when you went to your first broadway play (Wicked)--AND the second (Alladin)! We experienced our first big show together at Champions Square in NOLA to see Panic! At the Disco! You were wearing the tank top I bought you as a birthday present and I knew I was the luckiest man alive to be there with you. You were perfect--and you still are. And now--as we move into this marriage, we have bought our first house together, and I pray that we will fill it with our kids so that one day we can be there together with them as they experience all of their first things in our new home! <br/><br/> I promise to always be your best friend and always be there for you, no matter what. I promise to never go to bed angry. I promise to always be your biggest fan. I promise to support you through thick and thin--through the good times and the bad. I promise to spoil you--with moderation. I promise to love you unconditionally until we are old and wrinkly. I promise to share all of myself with all of you and always be honest, loyal, committed, and passionate. <br/><br/> I don't care what you wear, how much you weigh, what you look like, what brand shoes you have, or how expensive your makeup was--You are my world and I love you just the way you are.</span> <br/><br/> by Dylan Legendre </p></div><div id="exampleModal" class="modal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog"> <div class="modal-dialog" role="document"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modal-header"> <h5 class="modal-title">Reason #<span id="txtReasonIndex"></span></h5> <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"> <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span> </button> </div><div class="modal-body"> <p class="lead"> I love you because <span id="txtReason"></span>! </p></div><div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button> </div></div></div></div></div><script>$(()=>{// The reasons why i love you! // Change these if you want to show different reasons!
